# About Me

## My Interests
I love watching movies and playing video games.  
Some of my favorites are:
* _Everything everywhere All at Once_
* The _Uncharted_ game series
* _Spider-Man_
* The _James Bond_ movies

I have 6 little dogs and I have always liked coding and wanted to make my own program. I worked with GitHub a bit, but never really learned just how much I could customize!
## Websites I Recommend
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) - Wikipedia has always been a useful way to get a quick summary or explanation to things.
* [YouTube](www.youtube.com) - This has always been a great way for me to not only find entertainment after a long day of work, or to find a tutorial or guide for something I need help on.
